# Interactive Map of Bar Trivia events in Columbus, Ohio
A project that generates a comprehensive and interactive map of bar trivia nights in Columbus, Ohio.

## Description
This project uses Python and the Folium library to create an interactive map based on data sourced from a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/1cwl7eo/columbus_area_trivia_master_list/?rdt=46370) on r/Columbus. All credit for the data goes to the user [smf1114](https://www.reddit.com/user/smf1114/). The data is extracted from the Google Sheets document in the post and visualized on the map. The map is then exported as an `.html` file that can be opened in any web browser.
